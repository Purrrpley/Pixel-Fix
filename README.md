# Pixel Fix

A WIP (and currently pretty broken) small* Minecraft resource pack fixing a bunch of pixel misalignments, such as:
![Misaligned pixels on oxidised cut copper stairs](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FKuEAE7WYAYVtS_.jpg)

*sort of - this pack is meant to fix barely noticeable details, however due to limitations in Minecraft's resource packs system there are quite a lot of files here. It should be fully compatible with other resource packs as long as they don't change the models of blocks.

# How it works

This works by mirroring north and east faces on the X axis, and mirroring bottom faces on the Y axis, like [this](https://youtu.be/RPvzI8U0SzU).
